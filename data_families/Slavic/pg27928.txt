TRESC:

Adam Asnyk:
    Pobudka.
    Szczesliwe ludy!
    Póki w narodzie...
    Miejmy nadzieje!
    Dzien nadchodzi.




Adam Asnyk urodzil sie w Kaliszu w roku 1838. Jako mlodzieniec bral
udzial w przygotowaniach do powstania 1863 roku, byl pózniej czlonkiem
Rzadu Narodowego i po przegranej musial wyjechac z kraju. Nigdy juz
odtad nie zobaczyl swych rodzinnych stron. Poczatkowo wpadl
w zwatpienie, nastepnie jednak wlasna mysla doszedl do niezachwianej
wiary w zwyciestwo sprawiedliwosci na ziemi, odrodzenie Polski
i przyszle szczescie ludzkosci. W pieknych swoich wierszach wiare te
staral sie wpoic rodakom w najciezszych chwilach zycia Narodu.

Umarl w Krakowie w 1897 r. Pochowano go na Skalce w grobach
Zasluzonych.




Pobudka.


    Precz ze zwatpieniem, co lamie
    I meskich pozbawia sil--
    Niech targa skrwawione ramie
    Lancuch, co w cialo sie wpil.

    Precz z maloduszna rozpacza,
    Niewolno rozpaczac nam!
    Niech mysli zuchwale skacza
    Do niebios zamknietych bram!

    Niech biegna, jak hufce zbrojne
    I sztandar rozwina swój,
    Niech spiesza na swieta wojne,
    Na wielki o prawde bój.

    Niechaj nas kleski nie strasza,
    Niech haslo bojowe brzmi:
    Za nasza wolnosc i wasza
    Za przyszlych braterstwa dni!

    Choc jeden za drugim pada
    Z czcicieli duchowych zórz,
    Choc przemoc, odstepstwo, zdrada
    W ich lonie zatapia nóz,

    Choc twierdza w gruzy sie wali,
    Choc plonie nad glowa dom--
    Nie dajcie, zakuci w stali,
    Przystepu rozpaczy lzom!

    Lecz orez dobrawszy swiezy
    W obronie czlowieczych praw,
    Ostatnia garstko rycerzy,
    Do konca swe czolo staw!

    Duch ludzki wszak nie na wieki
    W krwiozerczych zatonal snach
    I szydzac z jutrzni dalekiej,
    Uwielbil przemoc i strach.

    Nie zawsze narodów pycha
    Bezmyslna wladania chuc,
    Przed sila ugnie sie cicha,
    By w oczy ofiarom pluc;

    Nie zawsze na cudze chciwa
    Bedzie wsród przeklenstw i skarg
    Kuc drugim kajdan ogniwa,
    Az wlasny zakuje kark.

    Powoli swiatlo sie wciska
    I dalej posuwa w glab...
    A jak Jerycho w zwaliska
    Od dzwieku runelo trab,

    Tak runie w swietlanej zorzy
    Wiezienia ponury gmach...
    I ludzkosc oczy otworzy
    Po przeszlych zbudzona snach.

    Wiec w naszym krwawym pochodzie
    Zwatpienie i rozpacz precz!
    Ze szczesciem ludzkosci w zgodzie
    Uchwycmy duchowy miecz.

    Chociaz nas wrogi opasza,
    Niech haslo bojowe brzmi:
    Za nasza wolnosc i wasza!
    Za przyszlych braterstwa dni!



Szczesliwe ludy!


    Szczesliwe ludy! gdy im w górze swieci
    Wolnej ojczyzny widoma potega,
    Co darzac blaskiem najubozsze dzieci,
    W podziemia nedzy i bolesci siega.

    Szczesliwe kraje! gdzie pokolen praca
    Nie idzie w niwecz wsród gromów i burzy,
    Lecz gdzie czyn wszelki ojczyzne wzbogaca
    I gdzie mysl kazda jej tryumfom sluzy.

    Szczesliwe ludy i szczesliwe kraje,
    Gdzie geniusz wodza, bohatera mestwo
    I zywot, który w ofierze oddaje,
    Wielkim ideom zapewnia zwyciestwo.

    Tam nawet nedzarz, którego w proch zetrze
    Zawzietosc losu -- glowe wznosi smialo,
    Gdyz w piers wciagajac rodzinne powietrze,
    Oddycha szczesciem narodu i chwala.

    Tam sa szczesliwi, co w niedoli moga
    Snic, ze ich dzieciom losy sie usmiechna
    I ze spokojem patrzec w przyszlosc bloga
    I o pomyslnosc oprzec sie powszechna.




Póki w narodzie...


    Póki w narodzie mysl swobody zyje,
    Wola i godnosc i mestwo czlowiecze,
    Póki sam w rece nie odda sie czyje
    I praw sie swoich do zycia nie zrzecze,

    To ani lancuch, co mu sciska szyje,
    Ani utkwione w jego piersiach miecze,
    Ani go przemoc zadna nie zabije
    I w noc dziejowej hanby nie zawlecze.

    Zginac on moze z wlasnej tylko reki,
    Gdy nim owladnie rozpacz senna, glucha,
    Co mu spoczynek wskaze w grobie miekki

    I to zwatpienie, co szepcze do ucha.
    Ze jednem tylko lekarstwem na meki
    Jest dobrowolne samobójstwo ducha.




Miejmy nadzieje...


    Miejmy nadzieje! Nie te licha, marna,
    Co rdzen spróchnialy w watly kwiat ubiera,
    Lecz te niezlomna, która tkwi jak ziarno
    Przyszlych poswiecen w duszy bohatera.

    Miejmy nadzieje! Nie te chciwa zludzen
    Slepego szczescia plocha zalotnice,
    Lecz te, co w grobach czeka dnia przebudzen
    I przechowuje orez i przylbice.

    Miejmy odwage! Nie te jednodniowa,
    Co w rozpaczliwem przedsiewzieciu pryska,
    Lecz te, co z wiecznie podniesiona glowa
    Nie da sie zepchnac z swego stanowiska.

    Miejmy odwage! Nie te tchnaca szalem,
    Która na oslep leci bez oreza,
    Lecz te, co sama niezdobytym walem
    Przeciwne losy staloscia zwycieza.

    Przestanmy wlasna piescic sie bolescia,
    Przestanmy ciaglym lamentem sie poic,
    Kochac sie w skargach jest rzecza niewiescia
    Mezom nalezy w milczeniu sie zbroic.

    Lecz nie przestajmy czcic swietosci swoje
    I przechowywac idealów czystosc,
    Do nas nalezy dac im moc i zbroje,
    By z kraju marzen przeszly w rzeczywistosc.




Dzien nadchodzi.


    Niegdys, niegdys z pod Wawelu
    Mlódz rycerska biegla w zbroi,
    Do jasnego biegla celu,
    Nadstawiajac piersi swojej.

    Przy zakonie stojac twardo
    I przy prawie swem czlowieczem,
    Z meska smierci szla pogarda.
    Chrzescijanstwa bronic mieczem;

    I w oreznej swiata dobie,
    W której wszystko krwia sie placi,
    Wywalczala chwale sobie,
    A ochrone slabszej braci.

    Ten rycerski dzien wyslugi
    Juz sie skonczyl--juz obronce
    Na spoczynek poszli dlugi
    I nad nimi zaszlo slonce

    Przeszlosc cala, jasna, zywa
    Zatonela w nocna cisze,
    Lecz w podziemiach, gdzie spoczywa,
    Mlode dziecie znów kolysze.

    I choc jeszcze chmurno, mroczno,
    Juz sie sercem budza mlodzi,
    Czuc juz jasnosc niewidoczna,
    Czuc, ze nowy dzien nadchodzi.

    Dzien nadchodzi, w którym ludy
    Rozdzielone krwia przelana,
    Nienawiscia zbrojne wprzódy,
    Do bratniego kola stana.

    I na gruzach krwawej pychy
    I plemiennych walk szalenstwa
    Wzniosa w niebo oltarz cichy
    Zwycieskiego czlowieczenstwa.

    W tym dniu nowa zbroje wlozym
    I na serca walczyc bedziem
    I milosci duchem bozym
    Swiat ogarniem i zdobedziem.

contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
